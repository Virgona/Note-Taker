## Motovation

I wanted to create an app where a user could easily store notes and delete them. I wanted use as much code as I could on the back end and test my skills on using request params and routes

## Installation

No installation required! Just follow the link - https://note-taker-app-project.herokuapp.com/

## Challenges

For a while I couldnt understand how to write a delete request. It wasnt computing to me how to tell the code to delete a specific piece of code. Once it cracked that I needed to read and rewrite the objects it was really eye opening and a big relief

## Successes

Making my first ever deployment on heroku and it went smoothly!

## The App
